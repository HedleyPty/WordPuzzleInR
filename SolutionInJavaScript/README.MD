#Solution of the word puzzle in JavaScript

In order to access the solution in JavaScript open this [website](http://hedley.neocities.org/Challenge_word_puzzles/index.html). 

I added interactivity to the puzzle: if a correct letter is selected it becomes yellow (I change the style.color property to yellow), if you click in a wrong letter, it becomes lowercase.

The you can see the source of the page and access the "main.js" file from there.
